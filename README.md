# ENCM511_MT_Multimeter

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

This project aimed to design a multi-meter capable of measuring voltage, resistance, and the amplitude and frequency of a pulse signal, to be displayed on the computer terminal. This was to be done using the PIC24F16KA101 MCU and its peripherals.

### Project Objective

The project objectives included:

1.	To gain experience with embedded programming in C on the application level, with a focus on using peripherals like GPIOs, timers, and ADC modules.
2.	To solidify general embedded programming concepts, such as power, software, and hardware optimization methods.
3.	To introduce and achieve real-time operations and applications.
